The AI engineer's work began with building an AI auto-invest trading bot, integrating with Angel One and supporting LLM-driven trading decisions. The process was highly iterative, starting from basic functionality and progressively adding complex features based on continuous user feedback. Key challenges involved debugging environment setup, resolving persistent frontend UI issues related to JSX and unicode, and fixing backend logic for Angel One authentication and LLM integration. The engineer meticulously addressed user requests for portfolio visibility, dynamic trading strategies (SIP, Buy, Sell, Hold), configurable analysis parameters, and a comprehensive dashboard. Significant effort was placed on refining the bot's intelligence, incorporating tax harvesting, re-entry logic, and robust error handling. The trajectory concludes with the engineer addressing crucial security concerns regarding API key management and refining trading logic to prevent selling at a loss, demonstrating a strong commitment to delivering a secure and functional application.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested an AI-powered automatic investment bot connecting to Angel One, capable of portfolio analysis, smart SIP/Buy/Sell decisions using an LLM, and controlled via a dashboard. Key enhancements evolved to include configurable ETFs, dynamic LLM selection (Emergent LLM/OpenAI), Telegram notifications, and an editable analysis parameters field. Further requirements focused on advanced SIP optimization with auto sell/re-entry logic, considering tax implications and configurable thresholds (e.g., 5% minimum gain). The dashboard needed sections for executed orders, performance summaries, and LLM query controls (e.g., tax harvesting toggle). Additionally, logging of LLM prompts/responses for transparency, removal of auto-save, flexible frequency intervals (daily/multiple times), and a strict never sell in loss rule (except for tax harvesting with immediate re-buy) were requested. Finally, separating API keys/passwords from committed files into a database for enhanced security was a critical recent requirement.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.



- ****:
    - **Summary**: This is the core of the backend, implementing FastAPI routes, MongoDB interactions, Angel One API integration, LLM calls, and the trading bot's logic via APScheduler. It handles authentication, portfolio management, watchlist strategies (SIP, Buy, Sell, Hold), and logging.
    - **Changes**:
        - Initial implementation of CRUD endpoints for bot config and watchlist.
        - Integration with Angel One for portfolio fetching, login (updated to MPIN authentication).
        - LLM decision-making functions, updated to handle  logic, tax harvesting, and specific prompts.
        - API endpoints for , , , , , , , , , , , and .
        - Error handling for MongoDB  and LLM connection issues.
        - Refinements to SIP and sell logic based on user feedback (e.g., no selling at loss unless specific tax harvesting conditions).

- ****:
    - **Summary**: This is the main React component rendering the dashboard UI. It manages application state, fetches data from the backend APIs, displays portfolio holdings, watchlist items, bot controls, analysis logs, and implements user interactions.
    - **Changes**:
        - Initial dashboard structure with Control Panel, Watchlist, Analysis Logs tabs.
        - Dynamic display of portfolio data, watchlist items with P&L.
        - Integration of SIP/Buy/Sell/Hold actions for watchlist items.
        - UI for LLM configuration, analysis parameters, Telegram settings, schedule.
        - Added Portfolio Analysis tab with a button to trigger AI analysis and display results.
        - Implemented new controls for auto sell threshold, minimum gain, and tax harvesting.
        - Added a Test Connection button for LLM.
        - Resolved multiple JSX and unicode escape sequence errors during development.
        - Replaced auto-save functionality with explicit Save buttons for configurations.
        - Added enhanced frequency options for the bot scheduler.

- ** & **:
    - **Summary**: These files store environment variables for backend (MongoDB URL, Angel One credentials) and frontend (Backend API URL).
    - **Changes**: Initial setup of Angel One credentials. User explicitly requested these be moved to the database for security, which is the current work.

- ** & **:
    - **Summary**: Manage Python and Node.js dependencies, respectively.
    - **Changes**: Dependencies like , , ,  were added for the backend. Frontend dependencies were managed by yarn install v1.22.22

<pending_tasks>
- Separate Angel One API keys and passwords from  files and store them securely in the database, controlled from the dashboard, and remove them from committed files.
- Ensure all configuration sections in the frontend use explicit Save buttons instead of auto-save, which was partially implemented but requires full coverage.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing critical user feedback regarding the application's functionality and security. The work involved:

1.  **Removing Auto-Save**: Implementing explicit Save or Update options for configuration changes on the dashboard, moving away from auto-save which was causing UI problems. This involved modifying frontend components () to manage a  state and only persisting changes upon a user-initiated save.
2.  **Enhanced Frequency Options**: Adding more flexible scheduling options for the bot's execution frequency, including once a day or multiple times a day with different frequency intervals, configurable from the dashboard. This would involve updates to both the frontend UI and backend scheduler logic.
3.  **Corrected Trading Thresholds and Sell Logic**: Crucially, the sell strategy was refined to prevent selling at a loss under normal circumstances. The rule is now: Never sell in loss except in case of tax harvesting where you re-enter again immediately. This required updates to the LLM prompts in  to ensure the AI considers this new constraint during its decision-making process for SIP and sell actions.
4.  **Credential Separation (Initiated)**: The user requested to separate Angel One API keys and passwords into a database, controllable from the dashboard, and remove them from committed files. The AI engineer acknowledged this as the next immediate step and stated, Let me separate credentials into the database and remove them from files that will be committed to GitHub. This task has been initiated but not completed within the provided trajectory.

The current state reflects a working dashboard with integrated Angel One portfolio display, functional LLM calls (for Emergent LLM, OpenAI needs a valid key), configurable trading parameters (including tax harvesting toggle and threshold sliders), and the refined save/frequency/sell logic.
