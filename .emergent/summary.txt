The AI engineer has systematically developed an AI auto-invest trading bot using FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, integrating with Angel One and LLMs. The work progressed from foundational features to addressing complex user requirements and bugs. Key areas of focus included resolving  and  errors, refining LLM prompts for dynamic decisions, enhancing UI for user interaction and data display, and improving system reliability (e.g., scheduler, market checks). Recent critical updates involved ensuring the  flag functions correctly, implementing robust SIP frequency checks, integrating dynamic market status checks for bot execution, and completely overhauling SIP exit and re-entry logic with balance reservation. The engineer also fixed LLM prompt formatting, added ISIN to LLM calls, and refined profit tracking. The current task involves integrating comprehensive market data into LLM prompts for all actions, specifically addressing a missing market data inclusion in SELL prompts.

<product_requirements>
The goal is an AI-powered auto-investment bot for Angel One, enabling portfolio analysis and LLM-driven SIP/Buy/Sell decisions via a dashboard. This includes configurable ETFs, dynamic LLM selection, and editable analysis parameters, with advanced features like SIP optimization, tax harvesting, re-entry logic, and a never sell in loss rule (with tax harvesting exception). The dashboard needs to display executed orders, performance summaries, LLM query controls, and comprehensive logging. Security and usability enhancements include database storage for API keys, explicit Save buttons, and flexible bot scheduling. Recent detailed requests focused on refining SIP logic to include portfolio context, dynamic amount adjustment based on price/indicators, an exit now check, real Angel One balance fetching with minimum balance threshold, honoring  for all runs, market open checks for automatic runs, dashboard UI rearrangement, and accurate realized profit tracking. Furthermore, the bot needs SIP re-entry logic with reserved amounts, editable re-entry details, removal of unused SIP fields (amount, frequency), LLM prompt optimization for re-entry and ISIN inclusion, and comprehensive market data integration into LLM prompts.

<code_architecture>

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Central logic for bot operations, API endpoints, Angel One and LLM interactions, and scheduling.
    -   **Changes**:  now includes  (e.g., ).  has new fields for  (flag), , , , ;  and  were removed.  now accepts  and  for richer prompts, with refined re-entry logic, updated prompts for SIP (dynamic amount), BUY, SELL, and re-entry (correcting price change calculation).  implements pre-run market status checks for automatic runs, enforces  flag, calculates adjusted  (subtracting reserved amounts), and passes ISIN and market data to LLM.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Main dashboard UI, displaying portfolio, watchlist, bot controls, and various logs.
    -   **Changes**: Dashboard rearranged (removed top Watchlist and Analyses widgets, added Total Profit/Loss and Market Days tab). Watchlist items now display an Awaiting Re-entry badge. SIP edit dialog includes editable re-entry fields (status, exit price/quantity, reserved amount, exit date), and / fields were removed. The dialog is now scrollable. Analysis logs display  with status badges. Realized Profit on dashboard now displays â‚¹0.00 with a disclaimer for pending profit tracking. The SIP: Rs.5000 every 30 days note was removed.
-   ****: New file defining Pydantic models for structured market data (technical indicators, fundamentals, index valuation, sentiment) used in LLM prompts.
-   ****: New file containing a service to fetch comprehensive market data from external sources for LLM analysis.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement all requirements from the provided document, starting with LLM enhancements and bot schedule fixes.
- Specifically, update the LLM prompt for SELL actions to correctly include comprehensive market data.
- Integrate the  into  and implement associated backend logic as part of the broader plan.
- Implement the user profile name display on the dashboard and suggest/implement an authentication layer.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the initial phase (Phase 1A & 1B: LLM Enhancement + Bot Schedule Fix) of a larger project to implement all user requirements. The focus immediately before this summary was on enhancing LLM prompts by integrating comprehensive market data. This involved creating  and  to fetch technical indicators, fundamentals, index valuation, and market sentiment. The  function and  in  were modified to gather this market data and pass it to the LLM. Testing revealed that while the market data fetching was successful, the SELL action LLM prompt within  was not yet updated to incorporate this new market context, leading to incomplete prompts for SELL decisions.

<optional_next_step>
Update the  function in  to include the fetched market data in the SELL action LLM prompt.
