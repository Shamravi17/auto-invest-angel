# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  User reported the following critical issues:
  1. auto_execute_trades flag not being respected - bot executes orders even when flag is False
  2. Automatic bot runs should check market status FIRST and abort if market is closed (not just skip)
  
  Previous resolved issues:
  - Portfolio analysis and LLM logging (resolved)
  - Angel One credentials in database with encryption (resolved)
  - IST timestamp format (resolved)

          User reported: Bot places orders even when auto_execute_trades is set to False
          This happens for both manual and automatic triggers
      - working: "NA"
        agent: "main"
        comment: |
          Fixed implementation:
          - Added detailed logging before order execution check (lines 1368-1376)
          - Log shows: auto_execute_trades flag value, LLM decision, manual trigger status
          - Added explicit SKIP logging when flag is False
          - Added explicit SKIP logging when LLM decision doesn't warrant execution
          - The if condition already checks config.auto_execute_trades correctly (line 1377)
          - Need to test both scenarios: manual trigger and automatic trigger

          User requested: Automatic bot should check market state FIRST
          If market is closed, abort the entire bot execution (not just skip)
          Only continue if market status is "open" or other active status
      - working: "NA"
        agent: "main"
        comment: |
          Fixed implementation:
          - Moved market status check to STEP 1 (before config loading) for automatic runs (lines 1217-1236)
          - Returns immediately if market is closed (line 1232)
          - Added better logging: "Market is CLOSED. Automatic bot execution aborted."
          - Manual triggers still bypass this check correctly (lines 1237-1248)
          - Fixed is_market_open() function:
            * Added check for both "open" and "normal" status (line 1167)
            * Changed default behavior on API failure: now returns False instead of True (line 1178)
            * Added detailed logging for each market status check
            * This prevents bot from running when market status API is down

          - Updated all toLocaleString() calls to use 'en-IN' locale with 'Asia/Kolkata' timezone
          - Added " IST" suffix to all timestamp displays
          - Applied to: Portfolio Analysis tab, Analysis Logs tab, LLM Logs tab

      Implemented fixes for two critical issues:
      
      1. ✅ auto_execute_trades flag: Added comprehensive logging to trace execution
         - Logs flag value, LLM decision, manual trigger status
         - Explicitly logs when orders are SKIPPED due to flag being False
         - The conditional check was already correct, but now we have visibility
      
      2. ✅ Market status check for automatic runs:
         - Moved market check to VERY FIRST step (before config loading)
         - Returns immediately if market closed (aborts entire bot execution)
         - Fixed is_market_open() to check for "open" OR "normal" status
         - Changed default on API failure: now returns False (safe default)
         - Manual triggers correctly bypass this check
      
      Ready for backend testing to verify:
      - Scenario 1: auto_execute_trades=False, manual trigger → Should analyze but NOT place orders
      - Scenario 2: auto_execute_trades=False, automatic trigger → Should analyze but NOT place orders
      - Scenario 3: Automatic trigger when market closed → Should abort immediately
      - Scenario 4: Manual trigger when market closed → Should bypass check and proceed
